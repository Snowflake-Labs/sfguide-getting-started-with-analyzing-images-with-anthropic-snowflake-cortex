# Getting Started with Image Classification with Anthropic on Snowflake Cortex

## Overview
In this guide, you'll learn how to build an end-to-end application for image analysis using AI models through Snowflake Cortex. This application leverages multimodal capabilities of models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Pixtral-large to extract insights, detect emotions, and generate descriptions from images - all within the Snowflake ecosystem. By the end of this session, you will have a clear understanding of how to implement AI-powered image analysis in Snowflake.
